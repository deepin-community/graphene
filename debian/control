Package: libgraphene-1.0-0
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends},
Multi-Arch: same
Description: library of graphic data types
 Graphene provides a small set of mathematical types needed to implement
 graphic libraries that deal with 2D and 3D transformations and projections.
 .
 This library provides types and their relative API; it does not deal with
 windowing system surfaces, drawing, scene graphs, or input.
